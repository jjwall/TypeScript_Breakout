# TypeScript Breakout
___

This is a remake of the classic game Breakout! This project involved my first ever experiences with TypeScript. I was pleasantly suprised with how easily I was able to pick up the language, but having a background in C# and JavaScript helped quite a bit. It is built with *zero* front-end dependencies (besides RequireJS). SQLite was used for the highscore system.

### To run the app
```
npm install
node server.js
```
